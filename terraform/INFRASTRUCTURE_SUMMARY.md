## 🏗️ Infrastructure Components

### Core AWS Resources
- **EC2 Spot Instance**: Cost-optimized GPU training (g4dn.xlarge default)
- **S3 Bucket**: Versioned model storage with encryption
- **S3 Script Management**: Training scripts uploaded to S3 and downloaded by EC2
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal permissions for S3 access and auto-shutdown
- **Security Groups**: SSH (22) and TensorBoard (6006) access
- **Auto-shutdown**: Terminates instance after training completion

### Key Features
- ✅ **Smart Script Management**: Scripts stored in S3, not embedded in user_data
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances save 50-90% on compute costs
- ✅ **Auto-Save**: Models saved to S3 every 50,000 steps
- ✅ **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA 12.0 with optimized ML libraries
- ✅ **Monitoring**: TensorBoard, Weights & Biases integration
- ✅ **Auto-Shutdown**: Prevents runaway costs
- ✅ **Checkpoint Recovery**: Resume training from S3 checkpoints
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Support**: Both single and multi-agent training

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Edit configuration
nano terraform.tfvars  # Update key_pair_name, s3_bucket_name, region
```

### 2. Validation
```bash
# Validate prerequisites and configuration
./validate.sh
```

### 3. Deployment
```bash
# Deploy infrastructure and start training
./deploy.sh
```

### 4. Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor training progress
./monitor.sh

# Or use individual commands
./monitor.sh status      # Check instance status
./monitor.sh progress    # Check training progress
./monitor.sh download    # Download latest models
./monitor.sh costs       # Estimate costs
```

## 💰 Cost Estimates (US East 1)

| Instance Type | On-Demand | Typical Spot | 8-Hour Training |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| g4dn.xlarge   | $0.526/hr | $0.15-0.25/hr| $1.2-2.0       |
| g4dn.2xlarge  | $0.752/hr | $0.22-0.35/hr| $1.8-2.8       |
| g4dn.4xlarge  | $1.204/hr | $0.35-0.55/hr| $2.8-4.4       |

*Plus S3 storage: ~$0.023/GB/month*

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### terraform.tfvars
```hcl
# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"
availability_zone = "us-east-1a"

# EC2 Configuration  
instance_type = "g4dn.xlarge"
key_pair_name = "your-key-pair-name"

# Project Configuration
project_name = "f1tenth-rl-training"
s3_bucket_name = "your-unique-bucket-name"

# Training Configuration
training_type = "sac"  # or "sac_multiagent"
total_timesteps = 1000000
save_frequency = 50000
```

### Training Types
- **`sac`**: Single-agent SAC training
- **`sac_multiagent`**: Multi-agent SAC training with 2 cars

## 📊 Monitoring & Outputs

After deployment, Terraform provides:
- **SSH Command**: Direct instance access
- **TensorBoard URL**: Real-time training metrics
- **S3 Bucket URLs**: Model storage location
- **AWS Console Links**: Direct management access
- **Cost Estimates**: Hourly pricing information

## 🛡️ Security Features
- **IAM Roles**: Minimal required permissions only
- **Spot Instances**: Automatic cost optimization
- **Auto-Shutdown**: Prevents accidental costs
- **Encrypted Storage**: S3 bucket encryption at rest
- **Version Control**: Model versioning and backup

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Key Pair Not Found**: Create with `aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name YOUR_KEY`
2. **Bucket Name Taken**: Use globally unique S3 bucket name
3. **Instance Launch Failed**: Check spot capacity in your region/AZ
4. **Training Not Starting**: Check CloudWatch logs via AWS console

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Check AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Validate Terraform
terraform validate

# Check spot pricing
aws ec2 describe-spot-price-history --instance-types g4dn.xlarge --max-results 1
```

## 📈 Performance Tuning

### Instance Selection
- **g4dn.xlarge**: Best cost/performance for most workloads
- **g4dn.2xlarge**: 2x GPU memory for larger models
- **g4dn.4xlarge**: Maximum performance for complex scenarios

### Training Optimization
- Adjust `total_timesteps` based on convergence needs
- Modify `save_frequency` based on training stability
- Use Weights & Biases for hyperparameter tuning

## 🧹 Cleanup
```bash
# Destroy all resources
terraform destroy

# Or use the deploy script
./deploy.sh destroy
```
